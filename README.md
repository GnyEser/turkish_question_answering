Here the NLP system is given a paragraph (orasingledocument)thatmayormaynotcontain the answer to the question, based on the context, the system should answer the question.[2][3] As the single-document open domain system dataset wewilluseTQUAD,thatistheTurkishQuestionAnsweringdatasetonTurkishandIslamicScience HistorywithinthescopeofTeknofest2018Artiﬁcial Intelligence competition and as for QA task we will use Simple Transformers Library based on Transformers Library by HuggingFace for the TurkishQuestionAnsweringtask.Wecreatedatest datasetbasedonTurkishWikipediaandausecase forwhichwecollectedtweetsmanually.
