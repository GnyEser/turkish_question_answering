### Abstract

Question Answering is focused on building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans.[1] There are various subcategories of Question Answering Systems. In this paper we are focusing on a Question Answering system that is classiﬁed as a single-document open-domain which is also referenced as reading comprehension. Here the NLP system is given a paragraph (or a single document) that may or may not contain the answer to the question, based on the context, the system should answer the question.[2][3] As the single-document open domain system dataset we will use TQUAD, that is the Turkish Question Answering dataset on Turkish and Islamic Science History within the scope of Teknofest 2018 Artiﬁcial Intelligence competition and as for QA task we will use Simple Transformers Library based on Transformers Library by HuggingFace for the Turkish Question Answering task. We created a test dataset based on Turkish Wikipedia and a use case for which we collected tweets manually.
